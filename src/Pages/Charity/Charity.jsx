          <p>
            We, at Chic for Charity, have always been firm believers in fashion for all. But somewhere in the midst of bringing luxury designers
            to every person, we forget that there are those in the world who don’t even have the luxury of comfortable clothing.<br /><br />
            So here we are, pushing the boundaries to believe in clothing for all; and we’d like your support in our initiative to help those in
            need to be able to lead a deservedly comfortable life.<br /><br />
            Browse through our display of an exquisite collection of outfits available to rent for a cause. In addition to renting, we encourage
            you to send in your unused clothes, which will be donated to orphanages in collaboration with our NGO partners.
